# MALICIOUS_NETWORK_BYHEAVY_HITTERS
Finding the Heavy Hitters from the database and then finding the contacts How are calling Often and then  matching the location. 
We are going to generate about 10 Million datas using Pyspark. Along with that assuming a 1M no of numbers about the details of the Caller_number registered on SIM, regarding the tracking of the location. And then Using the heavy Hitters algorithm to find out the count of Calls Made by Heavy Hitters.

- Then Those Caller_number is being Traced and experimented to find out whether they Follows the spam Caller_number Pattern or not.
- Marking them as Potential Spam.
- The Caller_number who are being marked as Potential spammers for more that a few times will be classified as Spammers.
- Then for those contacts Comparing the locations if most calls are made to different states and all are not same but varying then Potentially a Business call.
- Using Of ML algorithms to analyse already classified data and recognise the patterns and setting the barrier threshold for counts likes frequency of calls made per day.
